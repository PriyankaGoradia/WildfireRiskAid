## Overview


# Using Randomforest
- Extracted NDVI and NBR from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 imagery using Google Earth Engine (GEE)
- Simulated fire risk labels using vegetation and burn indices
- Trained a Random Forest model to predict fire-prone areas
- Integrated a Generative AI model (Gemini or Cohere) to summarize risk zones in natural language

# Spectral Incdices used and Data Labelling
- NDVI < 0.2 → vegetation is sparse/dry (potential fuel)
- NBR < 0.3 → possible burn signature or lack of vegetation
This is a quick way to label fire-prone areas for Random Forest model when we don’t have ground-truth fire data.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Extraction
- Used GEE to extract NDVI and NBR values for Alberta during wildfire season (May–September 2023)
- Exported 5,000 sampled points to CSV with latitude/longitude

### 2. Preprocessing
Python script to:
- Extract coordinates from `.geo` column
- Clean columns and simulate fire labels:
```python
df['Fire_Label'] = ((df['NDVI'] < 0.2) & (df['NBR'] < 0.3)).astype(int)
